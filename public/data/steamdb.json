The highly anticipated title features a new hero, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young Italian noble, and a new era, the Renaissance.  \t\t\t\t\t\tAssassin’s Creed 2 retains the core gameplay experience that made the first opus a resounding success and features new experiences that will surprise and challenge players.  \t\t\t\t\t\tAssassin’s Creed 2 is an epic story of family, vengeance and conspiracy set in the pristine, yet brutal, backdrop of a Renaissance Italy. Ezio befriends Leonardo da Vinci, takes on Florence’s most powerful families and ventures throughout the canals of Venice where he learns to become a master assassin.  \t\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>    EZIO, A NEW ASSASSIN FOR A NEW ERA</strong> Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a young Italian noble who will learn the ways of the assassins after his family was betrayed and he looks to seek vengeance. He is a lady’s man, a free soul with panache yet has a very human side to his personality. Through him, you become a master assassin.  \t\t\t\t\t\t          RENAISSANCE ITALY</strong> Italy in the 15th century was less a country and more a collection of city-states where families with political and economic strength began to take leadership roles in cities like Florence and Venice. This journey through some of the most beautiful cities in the world takes place in a time in history where culture and art were born alongside some of the most chilling stories of corruption, greed and murder.   \t\t\t\t\t\t          A NEW-FOUND FREEDOM</strong> You will be able to perform missions when you want and how you want in this open-ended world that brings back free-running and adds elements such as swimming and even flying to the adventure. The variety in gameplay adds another layer for you to truly play through the game any way you choose.  \t\t\t\t\t\t          DYNAMIC CROWD </strong>Discover a living, breathing world where every character is an opportunity for the player. Blending in with the crowd is easier, working with in-game characters provide ample rewards but can also lead to surprising consequences.  \t\t\t\t\t\t          BECOME A MASTER ASSASSIN</strong> Perfect your skills to become a master assassin where you brandish new weapons, learn to disarm enemies then use their weapons against them, and assassinate enemies using both hidden blades.</li></ul>  Please note that as of November 19th, 2018, the online features for this game are no longer supported.

        "name": "Half-Life 2",
        "description": "1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named \"Best PC Game Ever\" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.    \r\n\t\tNOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.    \r\n\t\tThe player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.    \r\n\t\tThe intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:    \r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial \"muscles,\" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>",

        "description": "From Valve (the creators of Counter-Strike, Half-Life and more) comes Left 4 Dead, a co-op action horror game for the PC and Xbox 360 that casts up to four players in an epic struggle for survival against swarming zombie hordes and terrifying mutant monsters.                      \t\t\t\t\tSet in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each &quot;movie&quot; is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.                       \t\t\t\t\tNew technology dubbed &quot;the AI Director&quot; is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.                      \t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life                      \t\t\t\t\t      Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.  \t\t\t\t\t      See how long you and your friends can hold out against the infected horde in the new Survival Mode  \t\t\t\t\t      An advanced AI director dynamically creates intense and unique experiences every time the game is played                       \t\t\t\t\t      20 maps, 10 weapons and unlimited possibilities in four sprawling &quot;movies&quot;                       \t\t\t\t\t      Matchmaking, stats, rankings, and awards system drive collaborative play                       \t\t\t\t\t      Designer's Commentary allows gamers to go &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of the game                       \t\t\t\t\t      Powered by Source and Steam                     </li></ul>THE SACRIFICE&quot;The Sacrifice” is  the new add-on for Left 4 Dead.    &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; is the prequel to &quot;The Passing,&quot; and takes place from the L4D Survivors' perspective as they make their way South.

You'll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons.

You'll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. You'll also encounter five new uncommon common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen.                    Helping to take L4D's frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0.

Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe game’s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    Product Features</strong>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>    Extensive single player:</strong> Featuring next generation gameplay and a wildly-engrossing story.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          Complete two-person co-op:</strong> Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          Advanced physics:</strong> Allows for the creation of a whole new range of interesting challenges, producing a much larger but not harder game.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          Original music.</strong>  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          Massive sequel:</strong> The original Portal was named 2007's Game of the Year by over 30 publications worldwide.   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t          Editing Tools:</strong> Portal 2 editing tools will be included.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li></ul>",

The new map - Krivoi Rog - gives players the largest tank slugfest to date, with 16 square kilometers of terrain, 3000 meter viewable range and up to 50 players. This map also features the new vehicle - the German Panzer IV G, providing the German players with some additional fire-power for the mid-war period.  \t\t\t\t\tIn addition to the new map and vehicle, an all-new adaptive bloom system has been added for the game's graphics, making the bloom crystal-clear even at low resolutions.

To cap it off, the BT-7 even carries tank-riders.      &quot;Black Day July&quot;:</strong> one of the very best for tank combat fans, set in the rolling countryside around Prokhorovka as German and Russian armor clash en masse during the Battle of Kursk.  \t\t\t\t\t      Increased player limits. A new level of intensity with 50+ player multiplayer battles (up from the previous limit of 32).  \t\t\t\t\t      New community made content, including the Russian BT-7 light tank with infantry tank riders and the first player controllable anti-tank gun in the game.  \t\t\t\t\t      New soundtrack: The &quot;Orchestra&quot; comes to the Ostfront - the game now features a complete in-game soundtrack from composer Matthew Burns.  \t\t\t\t\t      Gameplay enhancements. The addition of several features requested by the clan/ladder/league community to enhance competitive play.</li></ul>",

Your mission is to successfully exterminate your enemy's civilian population whilst saving your own. Points are awarded or lost depending on both the efficacy and thoroughness of your nuclear vendetta and the number of your own civilian deaths.  In order to win you must wipe out the enemy population and simultaneously disable the enemy's ability to retaliate against you. This is an extremely difficult task since launching an attack on the enemy exposes the positions of your own Ground Silos, Subs and Bombers the moment they launch nuclear weapons, making you extremely vulnerable and exposed to a crushing counter-attack.   \r\n\t\t\t\t\tDesperate attempts must be made to form fast, tactical alliances, alliances that may at any moment break-down to become the treacherous and most deadly of betrayals. Everyone looks to each other in a state of nervous suspense and paranoid accusation. In all-out nuclear Armageddon, everybody dies, everybody loses, you just have to make sure you lose the least!",

Meanwhile the Clans, recovering from their near-destruction, begin to reunite their tribes. They have received divine instructions and now seek to uncover an ancient ritual that will let them communicate with their god, Wotan.  \t\t\t\t\t     Disciples II: Servants of the Dark</strong> is a stand-alone expansion that brings you into the never-ending quest for supremacy as either the Undead Hordes or the Legions of the Damned.  \t\t\t\t\t On the dark side, the Legions of the Damned enact a plan to spread Bethrezen’s plague across Nevendaar. They sense the threat brought about by the rebirth of the Elven god and will stop at nothing to steal this power for their own purposes. Perhaps most pivotal to the conflict, however, is Mortis and her army of Undead Hordes. After all, the rebirth of her husband Gallean was her doing. He had rejected her for what she had become, a twisted, heartless beast.

This game features a blend of large-scale military conflict spread across large areas alongside the more close quartered battles.

Play it differently next time and find new ways to victory!  \t\t\t\t\t          Large scale multiplayer:</strong> Use ARMA Combat Operations' strong multiplayer mode and play battles where tanks supported by infantry and helicopters take control of an enemy city. The engine supports 50+ live opponents in a role of both friendly and enemy forces.  \t\t\t\t\t          More than 30 weapons:</strong> Every weapon has unique firing characteristics featuring the new and improved recoil system.  \t\t\t\t\t          Vast environment to explore:</strong> Explore Sahrani, an area over 400 square kilometers in size, full of flora and fauna.  \t\t\t\t\t          More than 30 modern vehicles:</strong> All vehicles in the game can be controlled - tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters, airplanes, civilian cars or even boats.  \t\t\t\t\t          Multiple gunners:</strong> Utilize the multiple gunner positions on tanks and helicopters to rain death on your enemies both in multiplayer missions and single player campaign.  \t\t\t\t\t          HDR Lighting effects:</strong> Ambushing an enemy with the sun in your eyes leaves you at the disadvantage. Think smart, fight better!  \t\t\t\t\t          Real constellations and tides:</strong> ARMA's great depth even includes such features as fully simulated star maps, lunar cycles and tides.

Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience.  \r\n  \r\nXpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience.  \r\n  \r\nThe game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events.  \r\n  \r\nXpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees.  \r\n  \r\nAlong with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving.  \r\n  \r\nThe interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games.  \r\n  \r\nFor the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods.",
